  A Java implementation of the Nilsimsa locality sensitive hash. The Nilsimsa 
  algorithm computes a 256 bit hash value that indicates how different two 
  strings are. The more similar the strings the smaller will be the bitwise 
  difference between their respective Nilsimsa hashes. Therefore, Nilsimsa is 
  well suited to detect texts of the same origin, such as slightly modified spam 
  messages, updated newspaper articles, etc. 
  <br>
  The {@link com.weblyzard.lib.string.nilsimsa.Nilsimsa#bitwiseDifference} method can be 
  used to determine how closely two Strings differ from each other by returning 
  the bitwise difference of their {@link com.weblyzard.lib.string.nilsimsa.Nilsimsa}
  hashes.

  <h2>Example code:</h2>

  <pre>
  Nilsimsa h1 = Nilsimsa.getHash("The first sentence.");
  Nilsimsa h2 = Nilsimsa.getHash("The second sentence.");
  
  System.out.println("The Nilsimsa hashes between these two sentences differ by " 
     + h1..bitwiseDifference(h2) + " bits.");
  </pre>
